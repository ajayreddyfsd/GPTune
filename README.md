# GPTune

This project investigates how emotional stimuli, persona-based prompts, and zero-shot prompting affect the quality of GPT responses using **PROMPTFOO**. By comparing these advanced prompting techniques with a basic prompt, we aim to uncover how emotional context, personality traits, and task-specific cues influence AI's behavior and answer depth.

## How It Works
1. Three types of prompts are tested:
   - **Emotional Stimuli:** Prompts designed to trigger empathy or context-aware responses.
   - **Persona-based Prompts:** Requests that influence the AI to respond in a specific tone or personality.
   - **Zero-shot Prompts:** Prompts where GPT is expected to perform a task with no prior example.
2. The quality, relevance, and clarity of responses are analyzed across these prompts.
3. The project seeks to determine how these advanced prompting methods compare to basic, neutral prompts.

## Why It Matters
Understanding how different prompts influence GPT's responses can improve interactions with AI in applications that require empathy, context, or task-specific knowledge. This experiment also highlights how zero-shot prompting can enhance AI's adaptability.

## Conclusion
By analyzing various types of prompts, we see that emotional and persona-based inputs lead to richer, more contextually relevant responses, while zero-shot prompts showcase GPTâ€™s ability to handle tasks without prior examples. This helps refine the use of AI in real-world applications requiring nuanced interaction and problem-solving.
